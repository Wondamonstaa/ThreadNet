ThreadNet - Empowering Concurrent Web Services

In the ThreadNet project, I embarked on a mission to enhance HTTP server functionality through the strategic implementation of concurrency and resource optimization. Leveraging the power of threading, I fortified the server's capabilities to handle concurrent requests seamlessly.

My accomplishments in ThreadNet include:

1. Concurrent Processing: I orchestrated a symphony of threads to transform a conventional HTTP server into a high-performance juggernaut. By introducing threading, I ensured that the server could gracefully handle multiple requests in parallel, significantly improving its responsiveness.
   
2. Load Balancing Mastery: ThreadNet takes load balancing to the next level. I meticulously designed and implemented load balancing techniques that optimize resource utilization. The result? An HTTP server that deftly distributes incoming requests among threads, ensuring equitable resource allocation and improved overall performance.

3. Efficient Connection Pooling: To further bolster the server's prowess, I introduced a sophisticated connection pooling mechanism. This innovation streamlined the management of database connections, eliminating inefficiencies and supercharging server performance.
